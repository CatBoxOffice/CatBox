      <p>
        Here at CatBoxOffice, good a film has cheezburger and a bad film gets
        scattered with the scat in catbox. Keep this in mind when you’re
        reviewing a film. Do you reward it with a juicy Cheezburger? Or do you
        banish it into the lost land of litter to wallow for an eternity?
      </p>
      <p>How do
        we know if a film has Cheezburger you ask? If a film receives a 75% or
        higher rating (scale of 1-100) it is rewarded with a big ol’ 80/20
        burgski. Anything else plummets to the catbox stinkfest where it
        belongs. It is up to you to choose it’s destiny!</p>
